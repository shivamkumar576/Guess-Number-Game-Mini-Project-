# Guess-Number-Game-Mini-Project-
A simple console-based number guessing game developed as part of learning basic Java programming concepts. The program generates a random number between 0 and 99, and the user tries to guess it. After each guess, the program provides feedback on whether the guess was too high, too low, or correct.
